Welcome to my Web Design Challenge Repository. This repository contains 7 html documents comprising the Latitude dashboard. They are organized in the following way:

  *index.html - Landing page.  
  *data.html - Page containing the dataset as a table.   
  *comparison.html - Page containing previews of the visualizations. Each image is linked to a visualization page with greater detail and analysis.

Visualizations pages:

  *max_temp.html   
  *humidity.html   
  *cloudiness.html   
  *windspeed.html    

Additionally, I've included a Python script used to convert the data (csv) to HTML.
